--Node js is server side scripting langauge.
   asynchronous calls
--package.json-- it contains metadata of the project

-module.exports
module-current module
export---an object that exposes the module outside
MIME TYPE
Contennt Type

JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation
JSON is a lightweight format for storing and transporting data
JSON is often used when data is sent from a server to a web page
JSON is "self-describing" and easy to understand


blueBird
--transllate all the call back  function into promises

--Package consist of multiplr modules

-onclick=event.stop.Propagation(); used for solution to bublling effect

Node js Quetions
1)What is Node JS
  --Node.js runs single-threaded, non-blocking, asynchronously programming, which is very memory efficient.
latest version node.js 14.0.8
  12.18.3  is stable one
12--major version
18--minor version
.3--bug related
to check --node -v
 
 2)diff between Asynchrnoud and Blocking
3)Node JS is single or multithreded??
  --why it is faster than others
4)what is callback function
3)Entery Point of node JS
    ---require statment
4)What is package.json
   --it contains metadata of the project
5)top modules
  --http
 --url
 --fs
6)if method or function is asynchrnous nd not use await then what will be the response
  ---The keyword await makes JavaScript wait until that promise settles and returns its result.
  --
7)difference betwen then and catch function
8)Async, await & then, catch
--in parent function we have to declare async
--nd function which returns promises we have to initialize keyword await

9)what is routing
 --which package we can used for routing
     --express --in that method called route
10)in middleware function what is request response and next
11)Default port number for node js
   ---3000
12)http method
   --get,put,post,
13)3 types  to send information to server
      req.param-single --user/id--only particular info
      key,value pair--req.query
    --req.body
14)port number--for success 200
      for request 400
      internal server error--503//not sure
    --HTTP response status codes indicate whether a specific HTTP request has been successfully completed. Responses are grouped in five classes:

Informational responses (100–199),
Successful responses (200–299),
Redirects (300–399),
Client errors (400–499),
and Server errors (500–599).
15)module
--is a program that writtem by us
 internal module
--which comes bydefault with the node js
 external module
--we have to install external packages

16)npm-node package manager
   npm -v ---
  npm init--to install  prebuild package.json
       ---to initialize the project--keep the information about version project name--npm init
      --help us to install an external modules nd uninstall
17)npm install bluebird---help us to download external modules
     --avaible on internet
npm js --all external modules available
18)dependencies--what are the external packages are install in our project that all are mention in the dependencies

18)by using async .function makes async nd return promises
19)we can make methos either by using async key or call back functions
---blubird convert callback into async

1)v8 javascript engine in node
--v8 is js engine for chrome engine
  they just modify chrome engine nd created node.js
2)call back in node.js
--Callback is an asynchronous equivalent for a function. A callback function is called at the completion of a given task. Node makes heavy use of callbacks. All the APIs of Node are written in such a way that they support callbacks.

For example, a function to read a file may start reading file and return the control to the execution environment immediately so that the next instruction can be executed. Once file I/O is complete, it will call the callback function while passing the callback function, the content of the file as a parameter. So there is no blocking or wait for File I/O. This makes Node.js highly scalable, as it can process a high number of requests without waiting for any function to return results.

3)npm js library
4)dev dependency
--used onli for development not affect running of project
--npminstall -m--to install nodemon
--dev env--prod env
nodeman server continuously check that node.js file running
--npm is a global library for node
--npm--to check libraries of node.js

--weekly downloads
--versions
--issues


5)testing framework
--karma.js--for unit testing
